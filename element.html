<h1>Welcome to my how to play Irelia</h1>
<h1>Lanning Phase</h1>
<p>Your first couple levels are really weak you want to avoid any trading with champions who will obviously outt trade you like darius or riven<br>Once you make your first back you wanna grab shen. This will give you a big power spike<br>At this pont you should be lvl 6 and you will most likely win your all in</p>
<h1>Fighting</h1>
<p>to get the most optimal amount of damage you need to play around your q as much as possible<br>Your stun is the hardest ability in the fucking world but also the most broken shit ever<br>Honestly once you get this shit down you basically will be able to jump rankks like no tommorrow<br></b></p>
<p>LMAO dasdadasadsad<p>
